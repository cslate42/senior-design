2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BIVC-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Vcc  - IOBank:13
Conflicting Vcc voltages in bank 13. For example, the following two ports in this bank have conflicting VCCOs:  
SDA[0] (LVCMOS18, requiring VCCO=1.800) and PmodJA1[0] (LVCMOS33, requiring VCCO=3.300)
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-87#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
IO/clock placer failed to collectively place all IOs and clock instances. This is likely due to design requirements or user constraints specified in the constraint file such as IO standards, bank/voltage/DCI/VREF specifications, together with the part and package being used for the implementation. Please check the above for any possible conflicts.

Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
2 out of 141 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: CS[0], PmodJA1[1].
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus PmodJA1[7:0] are not locked:  PmodJA1[1]
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-7#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
An IO Bus FIXED_IO_mio[53:0] with more than one IO standard is found. Components associated with this bus are: LVCMOS18 (FIXED_IO_mio[53], FIXED_IO_mio[52], FIXED_IO_mio[51], FIXED_IO_mio[50], FIXED_IO_mio[49], FIXED_IO_mio[48], FIXED_IO_mio[47], FIXED_IO_mio[46], FIXED_IO_mio[45], FIXED_IO_mio[44], FIXED_IO_mio[43], FIXED_IO_mio[42], FIXED_IO_mio[41], FIXED_IO_mio[40], FIXED_IO_mio[39] (the first 15 of 38 listed)); LVCMOS33 (FIXED_IO_mio[15], FIXED_IO_mio[14], FIXED_IO_mio[13], FIXED_IO_mio[12], FIXED_IO_mio[11], FIXED_IO_mio[10], FIXED_IO_mio[9], FIXED_IO_mio[8], FIXED_IO_mio[7], FIXED_IO_mio[6], FIXED_IO_mio[5], FIXED_IO_mio[4], FIXED_IO_mio[3], FIXED_IO_mio[2], FIXED_IO_mio[1] (the first 15 of 16 listed));
